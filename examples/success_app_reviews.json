I can't even record in my story anymore. Every time I try it deletes the whole thing and says the file type is unsupported.

The + on the main feed screen results in an error. 3) I no longer have the ability to schedule posts. I used to have it, now it's gone. This is HUGE for a small business who needs to regularly post content. Please fix these issues ASAP! Android user if that makes a difference.",

It auto scrolls to the next reel, refreshes without warning. Now, it won't let me see older posts of people I follow when I click on that option. It's responsive only 2/3 of the time. I don't know what's happening and it needs to be fixed.",

I can't create reels w/o it glitching & me having to either start over, or save the draft & ex out of the app. Even posting pictures is the same way. I try to adjust the photos as I click them, so that they're just ready, & as soon as I click the check mark to continue, it resets the photos completely off what I had designated. If I try to edit in the section that's MADE 4 editing, it blacks out & crashes. Even more issues!",
